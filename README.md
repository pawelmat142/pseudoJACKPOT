## General info
 This app is available here: [psudoJackpot](http://130.162.34.50:8001/) <br />
 The motivation to create the application was to broaden the skills and do the first project for the portfolio. During its implementation, I expanded my JavaScript knowledge and learned the basics of Node.js v17.4.0. On a VPS based on Ubuntu v21.10, I learned how to:
- install the Node.js application
- install the MySQL database
- implement communication between the application and the database
- using the GIT version control system

The graphics for the project were made by my friend [Krzywas](https://www.instagram.com/krzywas.ink/)
